# Rain Prediction

This project was done as a part of the Honors portion of the IBM Machine Learning Course on Coursera
### Built a classifier to predict whether there will be rain the following day or not.

I used a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. After cleaning the data, I applied various classification algorithms to create models based on the training data and evaluated their performance on the testing data using several evaluation metrics.

The algorithms I used included:

1. Linear Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

To evaluate the performance of the models, I utilized the following metrics:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. Logarithmic Loss (LogLoss)
5. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
6. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
7. R-Squared (R2) Score
